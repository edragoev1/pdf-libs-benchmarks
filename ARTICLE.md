# Generating PDFs in Java: a reproducible benchmark of four libraries

I wrote PDFjet, one of the four libraries compared here, and have been
updating it since 2001. For the last two months I have worked on it using
Claude. I commissioned this benchmark; Claude chose
the documents, their content and the way each library is used, wrote the
programs, ran them and wrote the tables. Both are reasons to be suspicious
of the results, so everything needed to check them is published in
github.com/edragoev1/pdf-libs-benchmarks: the specification of the documents,
every program, the scripts that run and check them, and the raw results.

**If we have configured a library badly, or used it in a way its users
would not, please tell us or open an issue, and we will fix the
configuration and run the benchmark again.**

## The libraries

| Library | Version | License | Java |
|---|---|---|---|
| PDFjet (core) | 9.1.7 | MIT | 8 and later |
| Apache PDFBox | 3.0.8 | Apache 2.0 | 8 and later |
| iText Core | 9.8.0 | AGPL-3.0 or commercial | 8 and later |
| OpenPDF | 3.0.5 | LGPL-2.1 or MPL-2.0 | 21 and later |

The newest releases on Maven Central on 5 November 2026. For the letters
with an SVG logo, the modules the others need to draw SVG, each at its
newest release: iText's svg module 9.8.0, Apache Batik 1.20, and for PDFBox
the pdfbox-graphics2d bridge 3.0.5.

Each library is used the way its own documentation shows: iText's and
OpenPDF's `Document` for flowing text, PDFBox's content streams with lines
wrapped by hand, as it has no layout of its own, and PDFjet's TextFrame and
Table, and for the report TextFlow. Every program reads the
font files from disk once, into memory, and each document makes its fonts
from those bytes, as a server would: iText and OpenPDF with their own
default caches, PDFBox with its TrueType font parsed once and reused, as its
API allows; PDFjet has no font cache and parses the bytes for each
document.
We ran iText both with its font cache and without it: without it,
iText takes 1 to 5 ms more per document. The results here are with font
caching.

## Features

What each library has, as of the versions above, from its source at the
release tag, its Maven POM and its documentation; only the features the
documents use were tested here. A module is another jar of the same
project; an add-on is a separate product of the same company.

*PDFBox has no table of its own, so its programs here draw the tables by
hand: a gray box behind the header, each cell's text measured to align the
numbers right, a rule under each row, the header again on each new page,
and the page numbers in a second pass once the pages are counted.*

The other jars each of the others needs at run time, from its POM: PDFBox pdfbox-io,
fontbox and commons-logging; iText io, commons, jackson-databind, slf4j-api
and bouncy-castle-connector, and its layout jar for tables and flowing text;
OpenPDF none: Maven adds brotli4j, its service jar and a native jar for the
platform, needed only for Brotli compression (OpenPDF ran here without
them). pdfHTML, pdfSweep and pdfOCR are iText add-ons under the same terms
as iText Core, AGPL or commercial; pdfCalligraph, pdfRender and pdfXFA are
commercial only. PDFjet Pro is PDFjet's add-on, commercial.

Far more people have worked on PDFBox, iText and OpenPDF than on PDFjet,
and far more people use them, with more answers on the web for every
question; iText also has a company behind it with paid support.

## What was measured

Five tasks, specified exactly in SPEC.md, the same text and the same layout
in every library:

- **invoice**: 1 page, the PDFjet logo, two address blocks, a table of 15
  rows, totals.
- **statement**: 12 pages, a table of 600 transactions with running
  footers "Page n of N".
- **report**: 18 pages, 120 paragraphs of flowing text and 4 photos, JPEGs
  of 1870 × 2420 pixels, 1.8 MB in all.
- **multilingual**: 1 page, a notice in eight languages: English, French,
  German, Polish, Turkish, Greek, Bulgarian and Ukrainian.
- **letters**: 1,000 one-page letters with the logo as PNG, and again as
  SVG, timed as the batch (with Noto, the SVG logo only).

All in **IBM Plex Sans**, embedded as subsets, and all again in **Noto
Sans**, a much larger font.

**Method.** Each library in its own fresh JVM, in a random order, three
rounds; within a JVM the tasks run in the same fixed order for every
library. Each task is warmed up for at least 20 runs and 3 seconds, then
timed over 15 runs (the letters: 2 warm-up batches, 5 timed); the figure is
the median of the three round medians. An asterisk (\*) marks a figure
whose rounds differ by more than 5%. The first PDF of a fresh process is the
median of 5 processes. OpenJDK 25, .NET 10, Go 1.27, Swift 6.4, on an AMD
Ryzen 5 5600G with Linux, after a reboot, in the performance power profile,
nothing else running. After the run every PDF is checked, and the log is published:
MuPDF opens it with no warning, it has the expected pages, the check
strings of SPEC.md are in its text (the last sentence of every language for
the notice), both fonts are embedded as subsets, and qpdf --check passes.

## Results

Time per document, warm, ms (the letters: the batch of 1,000, s). In every
table lower is better, faster, less memory, smaller files, fewer lines, and
the best of the four Java libraries is in bold. The last three columns are
PDFjet in C#, Go and Swift, shown with them but not ranked against them.

## PDFjet in C#, Go and Swift

PDFjet is also written in C#, Go and Swift: the same classes and the same
public API in each, and the same documents laid out the same way, which an
automated check compares on every change. The last three columns of the
tables above are the same documents made by each of them. For a
program that makes PDFs, what counts is what the port of its language
makes, and how fast: that is what those columns show.

Each port compresses its pages with the Deflate its language offers, but
for Swift: Swift offers none on Linux, so the Swift port has an encoder of
its own, which searches less than zlib. Its PDFs, the largest of the four,
are larger because of that encoder, not because of Swift.

## Reproduce it

Everything is in github.com/edragoev1/pdf-libs-benchmarks: SPEC.md, the text of
the notice, the logo and the photos, the program of each library and port,
the run and check scripts, and the raw results with their logs. java/run.sh
runs the four Java libraries (about 15 minutes) and java/check.sh checks
every PDF; run-all.sh runs everything, as for these results; dotnet/, go/ and swift/ run PDFjet's other ports the same way;
make-tables.py makes every table of this report from the results.

## Judgment calls

- The table rows of every library are 13.2 pt high, PDFjet's default for
  IBM Plex Sans at 9 pt; iText's and OpenPDF's cell padding was adjusted to
  match it, as without it their page counts differ.
- OpenPDF uses `setStrictImageSequence(true)`, or it moves text above a
  photo that goes to the next page.
- Every library is at its default compression: all four compress their
  streams, and PDFBox alone writes object streams, its default, which make
  its files smaller; iText and OpenPDF can write them too, as an option.
- PDFBox shapes ligatures (GSUB) by default on every showText, a cost that
  grows with the font's tables; the others do none, so it is turned off here
  (setEnableGsub(false)), as a PDFBox user who wants speed does. In the
  run of 26 October, with it on, PDFBox took 43 ms for the statement in
  Plex and 524 ms in Noto; without it, 5.8 and 5.4 ms.
- iText and OpenPDF use their large-table modes for the statement, as
  their documentation shows for long tables. iText's ordinary Table was
  timed too, and was slower (about 106 ms against 72, in the run of
  26 October).
- PDFBox's report time is almost all in reading the four photos:
  `createFromByteArray`, as its documentation shows, decodes each JPEG
  (about 38 ms here) to read its size and colors, then embeds its bytes
  unchanged. Building the image object by hand with `DCTDecode` avoids it;
  few users do.
- PDFBox draws one rule under each table row and one header rectangle,
  where the others draw a border under each cell: slightly less work for
  PDFBox.
- With Noto Sans, PDFjet's report is 21 pages to the others' 20, and its
  statement 13 to their 12: PDFjet spaces lines and table rows by the
  font's own height, and Noto's is larger than Plex's, so PDFjet makes a page
  more of each. With Plex every library makes the same pages (java/check.sh
  prints the counts side by side).
