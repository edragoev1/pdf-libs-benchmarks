# The whole benchmark, after a fresh reboot, with PDFjet at its release tag
# (git describe says v9.1.7, and the results say so): Java (the four
# libraries), then PDFjet's C#, Go and Swift, one after the other, each as its
# own run.sh does it, then the checks of every PDF. The computer is kept from
# sleeping while it runs; everything goes to results/overnight-<date>.log.
#
#   ./run-all.sh
#
# Start it from a terminal with nothing else open (each run.sh: "Nothing else
# should run"), and leave the computer alone. About an hour and a half.
#
# The CPU runs in the performance power profile for the whole run, held with
# powerprofilesctl launch, which gives the profile back when the run ends,
# failed or not: in "balanced" the clock moves with the load, which adds noise
# and could favor whichever library runs when the CPU has sped up (the owner,
# 5 November 2026). The machine's settings are written at the top of the log,
# for the report.
